""" --- Day 13: Shuttle Search ---

Part 1:
To save time once you arrive, your goal is to figure out the earliest bus
you can take to the airport. (There will be exactly one such bus.)

Part 2:
What is the earliest timestamp such that all of the listed bus IDs depart
at offsets matching their positions in the list?
